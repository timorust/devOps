```
NAT(Network Address Translation)
```

3. **What is the _Transport_ Layer _responsible_ for in the OSI model?**

```
End-to-end communication and data transfer
```

4. **Which protocol is connection-oriented and _provides_ reliable _data_ transfer?**

```
TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)
```

13. **How does PAT differ from Static NAT?**

```
PAT maps multiple privates IPs to a single public IP using different ports
```

14. **How does PAT differ from Static NAT?**

```
PAT maps multiple privates IPs to a single public IP using different ports
